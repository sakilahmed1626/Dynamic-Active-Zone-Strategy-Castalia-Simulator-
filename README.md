# Dynamic-Active-Zone-Algorithm-Using-Castalia-Simulator-
Dynamic Active Zone is a heuristic algorithm for wireless charging in Sensor network. The simulation is done using Castalia Simulator. 

How to Run the Simulation of Dynamic Active Zone Algorithm

To run the code of Dynamic Active Zone (DAZ) we need Castalia simulator. Castalia is based on Omnet++. It is recommened to use Linux environment for the simulation as Castalia is not compatible with windows yet. The steps are described below:

1.	Install Oment++. We used version 4.6. Please refer to the Omnet++ installation guide for further instructions. 

2.	Copy the Castalia-DAZ.tar.gz file  and untar it using appropriate command. 

3.	Install the Castalia using the Installation file. (Please note that this is a modified version of the original Castalia-3.2 simulator as we have changed the codes based on the requirement of DAZ).

4.	Set the environment variables.

5.	See the user guide of Castalia for necessary commands to run the DAZSimulation. 

All the necessary installation documents are in the ‘Installation Guide’ folder. The results of the simulation are in the ‘DAZ Simulation Results’ folder. Also the main part of the code is kept in the ‘Dynamic Active Zone Code’ folder.
